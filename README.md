Budget-Banana
=============

Budget Banana is a comprehensive budgeting system with the aim of helping you to better manage your financial situation.

**NOTE**: This project is just starting development. Please watch this project for updates. I hope to have something usable soon.

Budgeting Philosophy
-------------

Our central goal is to help you to get out of debt and/or increase your savings. You should be able to get by month-to-month without being surprised by major expenses. There are four simple rules:

1. Give every dollar a job
2. Save for a rainy day
3. Roll with the punches
4. Live on last month's income

Budget Banana is a web-based interface to help you to live out these four rules and get better control over your finances.
